          >Back to About Me(Anchor Link)</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is an anchor point for internal linking</p>

    <!--The <title> element above creates the title of the page 
    and it is displayed at the title bar not the body itself -->

    <!--
    The <head> element contains metadata and other important information
        that is only relevant to the browser and it is not shown in the webpage itself.
        It contains the <title> element, contains <link> element for linking external files including ".css" files.
        The <link> element is also used to create favicons. Favicons are those tiny icons/images near titles.     
        -->

    <!--The <body> element contains information seen on a webpage
        This means, all other elements within the <body> tags are all visible on a webpage.
    -->

    <!--The <h1> element is used for creating a heading.
        It is the biggest of all the six headings which ranges from h1 to h6. <h1> is the largest and <h6> is the smallest of all.
    -->

    <!--The <p> element creates a paragraph. And it is a block element, meaning, it is normally used outside another element and once used, 
        its contents automatically begin a new line creating a space between the previous content and the paragraph itself.
    -->

    <!--
        The <ul> element is used to create "unordered lists" which is used along with the <li> element as illustrated above. "li" means "lists"
        <ul> is used when you want to list items with no order. Using this element creates items which are bulleted.
    -->

    <!--
        The <ol> element, also used along with the <li> element, creates "ordered list".
        It creates items which are numbered.
    -->

    <!--
        The <a> element, which means, "anchor" is used when you want to insert a hyperlink. 
        It is used along with the "href" attribute, which means "hypertext reference".
    -->

    <!--
        NB: There are semantic elements and non-semantic elements.

        Semantic elements are HTML elements that clearly describes their meaning to both a browser and the devloper.
        Egs. <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <main>, <section> etc.
        This means, even if you're new to HTML, once you see, <header> in somenone's code, you will immediately have an idea what that will imply.
        Or if you see <nav> and you're told, "nav is used for creating navigation links", immediately, you will have a fair idea what it does.

        But then, non-semantic elements are the direct opposite of semantic-elements. Their meaning is different from the purpose the serve 
        and it may be confusing at first. Eg, <div> which means "division". At first glance, one may think, it divides codes or something but then they are just
        containers that makes styling with css easier.
